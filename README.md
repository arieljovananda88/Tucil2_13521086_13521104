# IF2211 Algorithm Strategies Course
## Finding The Closest Pair of Points in a 3d Plane Using Divide and Conqeur Algorithm
This project is a program that aims to find the closest pair of points in a 3d plane using the divide and conqeur algorithm. The achieve it, the program divides the plane in half on the x and y axis recurisvely multiple times. After a certain point it uses a brute force algorithm to find the distance, and then store the minimum in a variable. The program does it until all of the possible points are checked and outputs the results at the end.


## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
- A Python compiler

### Installing

1. Clone the repository to your local machine
``` bash
$ git clone https://github.com/arieljovananda88/Tucil2_13521086_13521104
```
2. Change directory to `src` folder
``` bash
$ cd Tucil2_13521086_13521104/src
```
3. Compile the program in `src`
``` bash
$  python Main.py or python3 Main.py
```

### Usage
The user will be given two choices, one is to prompt four integers or let the program generate its own random four integers when the software is executed. Once all conceivable combinations of these integers have been generated, the computer will employ a series of mathematical operations to determine a solution for each combination. In addition to providing the ability to save the solutions to a text file, the application will output all solutions and execution time in a human-readable format.
